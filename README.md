# StudentApi
This project is an API created with Spring Boot. I have implemented the following requests:
- GET (ALL)
- GET BY ID
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE (ALL)
- DELETE BY ID


#Setup
Install Java 8
Install postgresql

When you have all of the above, clone this repository and just run it. 

The port on which the app runs is 8085. (you can change it from the application.properties)

For testing I would suggest to install Postman.
